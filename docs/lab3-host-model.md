# Lab 3 - Host the inference model and identify your first bird!

In this lab, you will host the inference model and identify your first bird!  Here are the steps:

1. Create a SageMaker model from the training artifacts
2. Create a SageMaker endpoint configuration
3. Create a SageMaker endpoint
4. Test your model using the endpoint

## Create a SageMaker model

### Create the model using the console

* Click on `Models` in the `Inference` section of the left hand panel of the SageMaker console.
* Give the model a name such as `birds`.
* Leave the model with the default IAM role such as `AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionRole-20180926T121970`.
* Leave the Network setting as `No VPC`.
* Set the Primary container to the location of SageMaker's inference code image for `us-east-1` which is:
 `811284229777.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/image-classification:1`.
* Set the location of model artifacts to the full path of the trained model created in Lab 2 (something like: `s3://<bucket-name>/output/birds/output/model.tar.gz`, remembering to replace `<bucket-name>` with the name of your bucket.  **TBS: best way to get this without typing it!**
* Click `Create model`, and it will now show up in your list of models.

## Create a SageMaker endpoint configuration

* Click on `Endpoint configurations` in the `Inference` section of the left hand panel of the SageMaker console.
* Give the endpoint configuration a name such as `birds`.
* Click on `Add model` and pick the model you just created in the previous step.
* Click on `Save`.
* Click on `Create endpoint configuration`, and your new endpoint configuration will now show up in the list of endpoint configurations.

## Create a SageMaker endpoint

* Click on `Endpoints` in the `Inference` section of the left hand panel of the SageMaker console.
* Give it a specific name that will be referenced from other labs: `nabirds-species-identifier`.
* The endpoint configuration that you just created in the previous step should already be selected for you by default.  If not, select it.
* Click on `Create endpoint`, and SageMaker will create an endpoint for you.  The creation process will take several minutes.  Note that once it is in the running state, you will be billed until the endpoint is deleted.

## Test your model from a SageMaker terminal window

Return to your SageMaker Jupyter notebook and click on the `New` button on the upper right hand side of the notebook.  Select `Terminal` from the dropdown list.  This will open a new terminal window running on your SageMaker notebook instance.  From that window, you have direct access to the full set of lab materials such as the raw input images you explored in Lab 1, along with the packaged RecordIO files you created in that same lab.

In this section, you will use some images that your model has never seen before and run tests against the inference endpoint you created earlier in this lab.

You will be executing the following [test script](../labs/lab3/test_direct_sample.py).  To run the test, navigate to the Lab 2 folder and then run the test using Python:

```
export ENDPOINT_NAME=nabirds-species-identifier
cd SageMaker/bird-classification-workshop/labs/lab3
python test_direct_sample.py ../../test_images/card.jpg
```

You should see output like the following:

```
Bird is a: Northern Cardinal (Adult Male)(0.94)[772]
```

**should default the endpoint name in this script so that no one needs to set an env var**

This will invoke the SageMaker endpoint, parse the results, create and print a message telling you which bird species was identified.  If the confidence level was low, it will tell you the top 2 candidates.  Confidence levels are also printed.


## Alternatively: Test your model from the command line of your own environment

Windows
`set ENDPOINT_NAME=nabirds-species-identifier`

Mac
`export ENDPOINT_NAME=nabirds-species-identifier`


`python test_direct_sample.py ../../test_images/card.jpg`

**should default the endpoint name in this script so that no one needs to set an env var**

This will invoke the SageMaker endpoint, parse the results, create and print a message telling you which bird species was identified.  If the confidence level was low, it will tell you the top 2 candidates.  Confidence levels are also printed.
