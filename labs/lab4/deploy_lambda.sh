# This script deploys an updated lamnbda function.
# The lambda_code subdirectory must be pre-populated with the lambda function
# and the corresponding set of additional python packages that are required
# beyond those provided automatically by AWS Lambda.  In particular,
# numpy is often needed, but is not provided by default.
# Note that since AWS Lambda is run on Linux, the numpy packages cannot
# come from a Mac. The easiest way to get them is to use an EC2 Linux instance,
# install Python, create a virtual environment, install numpy in that environment,
# and copy the resulting packages.
# This script assumes you've already done this step and those packages are
# provided in the same subdirectory as the lambda function.

# this script should be run in a terminal window inside your SageMaker notebook
# that was created as part of the workshop.
