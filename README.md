# bird-classification-workshop
This workshop uses Amazon SageMaker and AWS DeepLens to identify bird species.

Here is the documentation for each lab:

1. [Lab 1 - Prepare images for training](lab1-image-prep.md)
2. [Lab 2 - Train the classification model](lab2-train-model.md)
3. [Lab 3 - Host the trained model and identify your first bird!](lab3-host-model.md)
4. [Lab 4 - Trigger an inference as new pictures arrive in S3](lab4-trigger-inference-from-s3.md)
5. [Lab 5 - Use AWS DeepLens to detect birds and trigger classification](lab5-deeplens-detect-and-classify.md)
6. [Lab 6 - Configure text notification with identified species (optional)](lab6-text-notification.md)
