# Lab 2 - Train the classification model

In this lab, you will train an image classification model to identify bird species.
Here are the steps involved:

1. Understand SageMaker's built in Image Classification algorithm
2. Define the hyperparameters
3. Create a SageMaker training job
4. View the results of the training

## Understand SageMaker's Image Classification algorithm

## Define the hyperparameters

## Create a SageMaker training job

## View the results of the training
