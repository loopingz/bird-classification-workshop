# Lab 4 - Trigger inference as new pictures arrive in s3

In this lab, you will configure your s3 bucket to automatically trigger an inference on your endpoint using images as they arrive in the bucket.  Here are the steps involved:

1. Create a Lambda function to identify a bird
2. Extend the function to publish to SNS
3. Configure your s3 bucket to trigger your Lambda function
4. Test by adding an image to s3

## Create a Lambda function

## Extend the function to publish to SNS

## Configure s3 to trigger your Lambda function
