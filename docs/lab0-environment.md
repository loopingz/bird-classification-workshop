# Lab 0 - Setting up your environment

## Cloning the github repository

`github clone https://github.com/markproy/bird-classification-workshop`

This will provide all of the content you need to get started with the labs.

## Preparing the AWS CLI (command line interface)

If you have not yet set up your environment to use the AWS CLI, follow [these](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html) instructions.

## Installing Python

If you do not already have Python set up in your environment, you can download and install Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installing additional Python packages

To complete all the labs, you will also need some additional Python libraries that can be installed using `pip` as follows:

`python -m pip install â€”upgrade pip
pip install boto3
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install mxnet
pip install opencv-python`
