# Lab 6 - Configure SMS text notification

In this lab, you will configure automatic SMS text notification whenever a bird species identification message is published on SNS.  Instead of looking up results in CloudWatch, you will immediately get them as a text on your cell phone.  Here are the steps:

1. Create an SNS topic
2. Configure a new subscription to your SNS topic
3. Test that bird species identification texts are sent to your phone

## Create an SNS topic

* Go to the Amazon SNS console on AWS.  
* Click on `Create topic`.
* Use the following topic name: `deeplens-sagemaker-birdpic-arrived` and `bird id` as the display name.  The display name will show up as a prefix to your text.
* Click `Create topic`.

## Configure new SNS subscription

* Under the `Subscriptions` section of the topic details, click `Create subscription` to begin creating the subscription.
* Pick `SMS` as the protocol.
* For the `Endpoint`, enter your cell phone number (e.g., `+16035551212`).
* Click `Create subscription` to complete the process.

## Test the subscription

Before configuring the Lambda function and testing the end to end process, first be sure that the SNS subscription works.  Publish a simple message and see if you receive the text.

* On your `Topic details` page for your topic, click on `Publish to topic`.
* Your `Topic ARN` will be filled in automatically.
* Enter a simple `Subject` like `Hello world`.
* Enter a simple `Message` like `Machine learning is fun!` with `Raw` selected as the `Message format`.
* At the bottom of the page, click on `Publish message`.
* You should see a text message arrive on your cell phone.

## Extend the Lambda function to publish to SNS

In [Lab 4](lab4-trigger-inference-from-s3.md), you created a Lambda function called `IdentifySpeciesAndNotify`.  It has code already built in that attempts to publish the species identification message to SNS:

```
mySNSTopicARN = os.environ['SNS_TOPIC_ARN']
response = sns.publish(TopicArn=mySNSTopicARN, Message=msg)
```

Now we will enable that code to work by providing a functioning SNS topic.

* Copy the SNS topic ARN.  You will be pasting it into an environment variable shortly.
* Go to the Lambda console on AWS.
* On the Lambda console, click on `Functions` in the left hand panel, and navigate to the `IdentifySpeciesAndNotify` function by clicking on that function name.
* Scroll down to the `Environment variables` section.
* Add `SNS_TOPIC_ARN` as a new key, and paste in the ARN of your SNS topic as the value.
* Click `Save` to record the updated variables.
* On the `Actions` menu, click `Publish new version`. Note the new version number.  Add a comment. Click `Publish`.

## Test

You can test out the notification by simply having the DeepLens detect another bird.  You should receive a text message with the species identification and confidence level.
